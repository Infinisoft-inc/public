### Minimalist Specification for Discussion Framework Architecture

#### Overview
The architecture is designed to facilitate communication between a frontend interface and backend services for a text-to-speech (TTS) application. It consists of four primary components:

1. **TTS Local Inference API**: Handles text-to-speech conversion.
2. **Transport Component**: Manages client-server communication.
3. **Communication Protocol**: Utilizes JSON for action and payload transmission.
4. **Playback Component**: Manages audio playback on the client side.

#### Components and Flow

1. **TTS Local Inference API**
   - **Function**: Converts text input into speech output.
   - **Input**: Receives text data.
   - **Output**: Generates an audio stream based on the input text.

2. **Transport Component (Client-Server WebSocket Endpoint)**
   - **Role**: Establishes and maintains a WebSocket connection between client and server.
   - **Functionality**: Ensures real-time, bidirectional communication.

3. **Communication Protocol (JSON)**
   - **Structure**: JSON format with specific action types and payloads.
   - **Actions**:
     - `talk`: Triggers the TTS conversion process. Payload contains the text to be converted.
     - `answer`: Delivers the audio stream to the client. Payload contains the audio data.

4. **Playback Audio Component (Client-Side)**
   - **Role**: Handles the audio playback of the TTS output on the client side.
   - **Functionality**: Receives and plays back the audio stream sent from the server.

#### Data Flow

1. **User Input**: The user inputs text on the frontend interface.
2. **Request to Server**: The text is sent to the server using the `talk` action via the WebSocket connection.
3. **Processing**: The TTS Local Inference API processes the text and converts it into an audio stream.
4. **Response from Server**: The audio stream is encapsulated in a JSON payload with the `answer` action and sent back to the client.
5. **Playback**: The client-side playback component receives the audio stream and plays it to the user.

#### Minimalist Design Considerations

- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increased loads with minimal changes.
- **Modularity**: Each component is independent, allowing for easy updates or replacements.
- **Efficiency**: WebSocket ensures efficient real-time communication.
- **Security**: Secure the WebSocket connection and protect user data.

This specification outlines a streamlined, efficient architecture for a real-time text-to-speech application, ensuring fast and reliable communication between the frontend and backend.

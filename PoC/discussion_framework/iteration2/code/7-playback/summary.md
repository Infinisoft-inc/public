Certainly! For the fourth component of your architecture, the "Playback Audio Component" on the client side, the goal is to effectively handle and play back the audio stream (received as a base64 encoded string) sent from the server. Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this:

### 1. **Receive Audio Data**

When the WebSocket client receives an `answer` action, it should extract the base64 encoded audio data from the payload.

Example of received JSON:

```json
{
  "action": "answer",
  "payload": {
    "audioData": "base64_encoded_audio_data_here"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Decode Base64 Audio Data**

The client needs to decode the base64 encoded string back into binary audio data. In a web environment, you can use JavaScript's `atob()` function for this.

Example in JavaScript:

```javascript
const base64AudioData = receivedPayload.audioData; // Extracted from the WebSocket message
const audioBlob = new Blob([new Uint8Array(atob(base64AudioData).split("").map(c => c.charCodeAt(0)))], { type: 'audio/mpeg' });
```

### 3. **Create an Audio Source**

Convert the Blob into a URL using `URL.createObjectURL()`. This URL can be used as a source for an HTML audio element.

```javascript
const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
```

### 4. **Playback Audio**

Use an HTML audio element to play the audio. You can either dynamically create this element or use an existing one in your HTML.

```html
<audio id="audioPlayer" controls></audio>
```

And in your JavaScript:

```javascript
const audioPlayer = document.getElementById('audioPlayer');
audioPlayer.src = audioUrl;
audioPlayer.play();
```

### 5. **Handle Playback Controls**

Implement UI controls for play, pause, stop, or any other audio controls you require. These can be linked to the audio element's JavaScript API (e.g., `audioPlayer.play()`, `audioPlayer.pause()`).

### 6. **Error Handling**

Include error handling for cases where the audio cannot be played. This could be due to decoding errors, unsupported formats, or other issues.

```javascript
audioPlayer.onerror = (event) => {
    console.error("Error in playing audio: ", event);
    // Handle the error appropriately
};
```

### 7. **Cleaning Up**

To avoid memory leaks, especially when dealing with multiple audio streams, ensure to revoke the created URL after the audio is no longer needed.

```javascript
audioPlayer.onended = () => {
    URL.revokeObjectURL(audioUrl); // Cleanup
};
```

### Testing and Validation

- **Test with Various Audio Lengths**: Check how the player handles different lengths of audio.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility across different web browsers.
- **User Interface Feedback**: Provide visual or textual feedback to the user about the playback status.

By following these steps, you should be able to implement a robust client-side playback component for your text-to-speech application, capable of handling audio streams efficiently and providing a good user experience.

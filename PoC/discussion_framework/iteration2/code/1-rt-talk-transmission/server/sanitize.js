 Sure, here's a breakdown of the steps to install TypeScript and create a basic configuration file:

1. Install TypeScript using npm:
\`\`\`
npm install --save-dev typescript
\`\`\`
This command will install TypeScript as a development dependency in your project.
2. Create a TypeScript configuration file:

Create a file called \`tsconfig.json\` in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the configuration settings for TypeScript.

Here's a basic configuration file to get you started:
\`\`\`
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "build",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
\`\`\`
This configuration file tells TypeScript to:\``

function sanitizeStringForTextToSpeech(str) {
    // Regular expression to match inline code (single backtick) and code blocks (triple backticks)
    const codeRegex = /`{1,3}[\s\S]*?`{1,3}/g;

    // Replace code blocks and inline code with "the following code"
    return str.replace(codeRegex, ' the following code ')
              .replace(/\n/g, ' '); // Replace new lines with spaces
}
console.log(d)
console.log(sanitizeStringForTextToSpeech(d))

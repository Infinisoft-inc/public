Certainly! Here are the revised scenarios for your WebSocket-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) service using direct audio data instead of URLs.

### Scenario 1: Basic Text-to-Speech Request with Direct Audio

**Objective:** Evaluate the basic functionality of converting text to speech and directly sending the audio data.

**Client Action:**
- The client sends a `talk` action with a short text payload.
- JSON sent from the client:
  ```json
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "payload": {
      "text": "Hello, this is a test message."
    }
  }
  ```

**Server Response:**
- The server processes the text, converts it to speech, and encodes the audio data (e.g., as a base64 string).
- The server sends an `answer` action with the direct audio data.
- JSON sent from the server:
  ```json
  {
    "action": "answer",
    "payload": {
      "audioData": "base64_encoded_audio_data_here"
    }
  }
  ```

**Learning Points:**
- Measure the response time and payload size.
- Assess the quality and accuracy of the TTS conversion.

### Scenario 2: Large Text Processing with Direct Audio

**Objective:** Test the system's handling of large text inputs and the resulting audio data transmission.

**Client Action:**
- The client sends a `talk` action with a large text payload (e.g., several paragraphs).
- JSON sent from the client:
  ```json
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "payload": {
      "text": "Long text spanning multiple paragraphs..."
    }
  }
  ```

**Server Response:**
- The server processes the large text, converts it to speech, and encodes the audio data.
- The server sends an `answer` action with the direct audio data.
- JSON sent from the server:
  ```json
  {
    "action": "answer",
    "payload": {
      "audioData": "base64_encoded_audio_data_of_long_text"
    }
  }
  ```

**Learning Points:**
- Analyze the impact of large payloads on processing time and WebSocket transmission.
- Monitor server resource usage during the handling of large text inputs.

### Scenario 3: Concurrent Requests with Direct Audio

**Objective:** Evaluate the system's capacity to handle multiple concurrent TTS requests and direct audio data transmission.

**Client Actions:**
- Multiple clients simultaneously send `talk` actions with different text payloads.
- JSON sent from clients:
  ```json
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "payload": {
      "text": "Text from Client X."
    }
  }
  ```

**Server Response:**
- The server processes each request, converts texts to speech, and encodes the audio data.
- The server sends `answer` actions with direct audio data for each request.
- JSON sent from the server:
  ```json
  {
    "action": "answer",
    "payload": {
      "audioData": "base64_encoded_audio_data_for_client_x"
    }
  }
  ```

**Learning Points:**
- Determine how well the server manages multiple simultaneous requests.
- Assess if there's any performance degradation or latency in data transmission.

---

**General Considerations:**
- Monitor the stability and reliability of the WebSocket connection throughout each scenario.
- Pay attention to the time taken for processing and transmitting data, particularly for larger payloads.
- Ensure that the WebSocket connection can handle the increased data load, especially in the concurrent requests scenario.

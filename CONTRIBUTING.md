# Code of Conduct

We believe in fostering an inclusive and welcoming community. We expect all contributors to adhere to our Code of Conduct. Please take a moment to read it before contributing.

# Getting Started

1. Fork the repository - Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the main repository.

2. Clone the repository - Once you've forked the repository, clone it to your local machine so you can start working on it.

3. Create a branch - It's a good practice to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you're working on. This keeps your changes isolated and makes it easier to review and merge.

4. Make your changes - With your branch created, you can start making changes to the code. Be sure to follow our coding standards and write tests for your changes, if applicable.

5. Commit your changes - Once you're happy with your changes, commit them with a meaningful commit message that describes what you've done.

6. Submit a pull request - Finally, push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the main repository. Our team will review your changes and provide feedback.

# Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a pull request, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Describe your changes - In the pull request description, provide a clear and concise description of what your changes do and why they are necessary.

- Reference related issues - If your pull request addresses an existing issue, be sure to reference it in the description.

- Keep it focused - Each pull request should address a single feature or bug fix. If you have multiple changes to propose, please create separate pull requests.

- Follow our coding standards - Ensure that your code adheres to our coding standards and style guide. This helps us maintain a consistent codebase.

- Write tests - If you're adding new functionality or fixing a bug, be sure to include tests that cover your changes.

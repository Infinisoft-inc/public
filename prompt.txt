ok lets use lerna . lets think step by step how to install, configure et an existing monorepo. Packages are ine folder   packages\@brainstack\[packages] packages\@braintools\[packages]

To install and configure Lerna for an existing monorepo with the structure you provided, follow these steps:

Install Lerna globally:
To install Lerna globally on your system, open a terminal and run the following command:
sh
Copy code
npm install -g lerna
Initialize Lerna in your monorepo:
In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of your monorepo and run the following command:
sh
Copy code
lerna init
This command initializes Lerna in your monorepo, creating a lerna.json file and a packages folder at the root level (if they don't already exist).

Configure Lerna:
Open the lerna.json file created in the previous step, and modify its content to match your monorepo structure. For the folder structure you provided, update the packages array as follows:
json
Copy code
{
  "packages": ["packages/@brainstack/*", "packages/@braintools/*"],
  "version": "independent"
}
The packages array specifies the paths to your package folders using globs. The "version": "independent" configuration allows each package to have its own version number, independent of the other packages in the monorepo.

Install dependencies and link packages:
In the terminal, at the root level of your monorepo, run the following command:
sh
Copy code
lerna bootstrap
This command installs the dependencies for each package, symlinks cross-dependencies within the monorepo, and hoists shared dependencies to the root node_modules folder, optimizing the installation process.

Add scripts and manage packages:
You can now use Lerna commands to manage your packages, such as adding new packages, running scripts, and publishing packages. For example, to run a script called build for all packages, use the following command:
sh
Copy code
lerna run build
Commit the changes:
Don't forget to commit the changes to your version control system, such as Git. This includes the lerna.json file and any other changes made by Lerna during initialization.
That's it! You've successfully installed and configured Lerna for your existing monorepo. You can now use Lerna commands to manage your packages more efficiently. For more information on Lerna commands and configuration options, refer to the Lerna documentation.

ok now change path is with a cpital P so   Packages. Add the version refix script with the name of the package. scaffold all into 1 script so I can install and confdigure from a 1 liner command script. lets go
To initialize and configure Lerna in your monorepo with capitalized Packages and a version prefix script, you can create a one-liner script. Here's how:

Create an initialization script:
In the root directory of your monorepo, create a new file named init-lerna.sh with the following content:
sh
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
npm install -g lerna &&
lerna init &&
echo '{
  "packages": ["Packages/@brainstack/*", "Packages/@braintools/*"],
  "version": "independent",
  "command": {
    "version": {
      "message": "chore(release): %s [skip ci]",
      "allowBranch": "main"
    },
    "publish": {
      "ignoreChanges": ["*.md", "*.test.js"]
    }
  }
}' > lerna.json &&
lerna bootstrap &&
lerna version --conventional-commits --conventional-graduate &&
git add . &&
git commit -m "Initialize Lerna and configure monorepo"
This script does the following:

Installs Lerna globally.
Initializes Lerna in your monorepo.
Configures the lerna.json file with the capitalized Packages folder and versioning options.
Installs dependencies and links packages using lerna bootstrap.
Adds a version prefix script that follows conventional commits and graduates packages with stable versions.
Commits the changes to your version control system.
Make the script executable:
In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of your monorepo and run the following command to make the init-lerna.sh script executable:
sh
Copy code
chmod +x init-lerna.sh
Run the script:
Now, you can run the init-lerna.sh script to install and configure Lerna in your monorepo with a single command:
sh
Copy code
./init-lerna.sh
This one-liner script initializes and configures Lerna in your monorepo according to your requirements. Remember that this script assumes you have Node.js and npm installed on your system, and you are using Git for version control. Adjust the script as needed to fit your specific environment and requirements.

write a readme unformatted markedown between <pre></pre> I  want to know how to build eberything once.. build ony one package, build and release all build and release one.. add new paclkage.. remove package.. add a new dependency to only 1 package.. add dependency to all.. remov edependecy for 1 package remove package for all..  i want you to script all these commands to prompts for answers. you will place all these scripts withihin package.json scripts.. you will create a wrapper cli that will show me these options of script sI got and prompt me and guide me trought the headless process to manage my monorepo.. lets go :)
To create a CLI wrapper that will prompt you for options to manage your monorepo, you can use Node.js to write a simple script. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Install dependencies:
In the root directory of your monorepo, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
sh
Copy code
npm install inquirer execa
Create the CLI script:
Create a new file named monorepo-cli.js in the root directory of your monorepo with the following content:
javascript
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env node
const inquirer = require('inquirer');
const execa = require('execa');

const actions = [
  { name: 'Build everything once', value: 'buildAll' },
  { name: 'Build one package', value: 'buildOne' },
  // Add more actions here
];

const performAction = async (action) => {
  switch (action) {
    case 'buildAll':
      // Replace this with the actual command for building all packages
      await execa.command('lerna run build');
      break;

you will scsffold everything with entire source code within 1 script I will execute to put that in place executing 1 command.
To create a single script that installs and configures Lerna, adds the required dependencies, and sets up the CLI wrapper, follow these steps:

Create an installation script:
In the root directory of your monorepo, create a new file named install-monorepo.sh with the following content:
sh
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
npm install -g lerna &&
lerna init &&
echo '{
  "packages": ["Packages/@brainstack/*", "Packages/@braintools/*"],
  "version": "independent"
}' > lerna.json &&
lerna bootstrap &&
git add . &&
git commit -m "Initialize Lerna and configure monorepo" &&
npm install inquirer execa &&
echo '#!/usr/bin/env node
const inquirer = require("inquirer");
const execa = require("execa");

const actions = [
  { name: "Build everything once", value: "buildAll" },
  { name: "Build one package", value: "buildOne" },
  // Add more actions here
];

const performAction = async (action) => {
  switch (action) {
    case "buildAll":
      // Replace this with the actual command for building all packages
      await execa.command("lerna run build");
      break;
    case "buildOne":
      // Replace this with the actual command for building one package
      // You will need to handle the package selection here
      break;
    // Add more cases for each action
  }
};

const main = async () => {
  const { action } = await inquirer.prompt([
    {
      type: "list",
      name: "action",
      message: "Select an action:",
      choices: actions,
    },
  ]);

  await performAction(action);
};

main();
' > monorepo-cli.js &&
chmod +x monorepo-cli.js &&
echo '{
  "scripts": {
    "monorepo": "node monorepo-cli.js"
  }
}' > package.json &&
git add . &&
git commit -m "Add CLI script and required dependencies"
This script does the following:

Installs and configures Lerna.
Installs the required dependencies for the CLI wrapper (inquirer and execa).
Creates the CLI script monorepo-cli.js.
Adds a script to package.json to run the CLI wrapper.
Commits the changes to your version control system.
Make the script executable:
In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of your monorepo and run the following command to make the install-monorepo.sh script executable:
sh
Copy code
chmod +x install-monorepo.sh
Run the script:
Now, you can run the install-monorepo.sh script to set up everything with a single command:
sh
Copy code
./install-monorepo.sh
After running the script, you can use the CLI wrapper by running npm run monorepo. You will need to update the CLI script with the specific commands for each action and handle package selection for actions that require it. Also, ensure that you have Node.js, npm, and Git installed on your system.

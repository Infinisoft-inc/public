# **Step 1: Traversing Existing Solution**

1. **Gather Requirements**: Before starting the traversal process, gather the requirements and objectives for understanding the existing solution. Determine what specific aspects you need to analyze, such as folder structure, code patterns, architectural design, or specific modules.

2. **Analyze Folder Structure**: Examine the existing folder structure of the solution. Identify the main directories and subdirectories used for organizing the codebase. Note any conventions or patterns used in naming and structuring folders. Understand how different components, modules, or features are organized within the structure.

3. **Review Codebase**: Perform a code review to gain insights into the solution's functionality and implementation details. Read through the code files, focusing on the main entry points, core modules, and critical components. Identify any code patterns, architectural styles, or design principles used in the solution.

4. **Understand Dependencies**: Identify the external dependencies, libraries, or frameworks used in the existing solution. Determine their roles and interactions with the solution. This includes analyzing package.json or requirements.txt files to understand the specific versions and configurations of the dependencies.

5. **Identify Design Patterns**: Look for recurring design patterns or architectural styles employed in the solution. Identify patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), or other custom patterns specific to the solution. Note how these patterns influence the code structure and organization.

6. **Document Insights**: As you gain insights into the existing solution, document your findings. Create notes or diagrams that capture the overall structure, key modules, dependencies, and design patterns. This documentation will serve as a reference for future steps and help in communicating the solution's current state.

7. **Identify Intended Functionality**: Determine the core functionality and intended purpose of the existing solution. Identify the primary features, user interactions, or business logic that the solution is designed to address. This understanding will guide the subsequent steps of creating a new folder structure and abstraction.

By following these steps, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the existing solution's structure and intention. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for further steps in the complex process orchestration. Let me know if you'd like to proceed to the next step or if you have any questions!

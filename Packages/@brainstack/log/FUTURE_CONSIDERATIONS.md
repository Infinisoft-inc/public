# Future Considerations

## Important Notes for Future Development

## Alignment with PMBOK
- **Decision**: Not to refactor the approach to align with PMBOK terminology at this stage.
- **Reason**: Focusing on a proof of concept to get it working quickly.
- **Future Action**: Revisit the idea of aligning with PMBOK once the proof of concept is validated.

### Benefits of Aligning with PMBOK
1. **Standardization**: Enhances consistency and clarity.
2. **Communication**: Improves understanding among team members and stakeholders.
3. **Best Practices**: Ensures adherence to industry-recognized best practices.
4. **Training**: Easier training and preparation for professional certifications.
5. **Integration**: Better compatibility with project management tools and software.
6. **Risk Management**: Structured approach to identifying and mitigating risks.

### Action Items
- **Future Consideration**: Keep the benefits of aligning with PMBOK in mind for future stages of the project.
- **Reminder**: Revisit this note once the proof of concept is successfully completed.

## Generic Workflow Service and Workflow Language Definition
- **Current Status**: Approximately 60% progress completed for the proof of concept.
- **Decision**: To leave the current workflow service and language definition as is for now.
- **Reason**: Focus on completing the proof of concept to ensure one workflow is functioning correctly.
- **Future Action**: Revisit the idea of creating a generic workflow service and developing a workflow language definition by configuration once the proof of concept is validated.

### Benefits of a Generic Workflow Service
1. **Flexibility**: Allows for the creation of various workflows without significant code changes.
2. **Scalability**: Enables the system to handle multiple workflows efficiently.
3. **Maintainability**: Simplifies the process of updating and maintaining workflows.
4. **Reusability**: Promotes the reuse of workflow components across different projects.
5. **Configuration**: Easier to configure and customize workflows through a defined language.

### Challenges and Considerations
- **Complexity**: Developing a generic workflow service may introduce additional complexity.
- **Testing**: Ensuring that the generic service works seamlessly with all workflows will require thorough testing.
- **Documentation**: Clear and comprehensive documentation will be essential for users to understand and utilize the workflow language.

### Action Items
- **Future Consideration**: Keep the benefits and challenges of creating a generic workflow service in mind for future stages of the project.
- **Reminder**: Revisit this note once the proof of concept is successfully completed and one workflow is functioning correctly.
- **Progress Tracking**: Continue to track progress and address any challenges that arise during the completion of the proof of concept.

## Additional Notes
- **Current Focus**: Complete the proof of concept even if it is not fully optimized. The goal is to have a working workflow that can be demonstrated and validated.
- **Future Optimization**: Plan for optimization and refactoring once the proof of concept is successfully completed. This will include addressing any performance issues and ensuring the workflow service is robust and scalable.

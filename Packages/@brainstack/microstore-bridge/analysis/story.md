## Story 1: Establish a WebRTC Connection
### Tasks
1. Set up a basic Express server with WebSocket support.
2. Implement the front-end WebSocket connection for signaling.
3. Implement the back-end WebSocket connection for signaling.
4. Create a custom signaling mechanism on the back-end using WebSockets.
5. Establish a WebRTC connection between front-end and back-end stores using the custom signaling mechanism.

## Story 2: Real-time Event Subscription and Exchange
### Tasks
1. Create an abstraction layer for subscribing to events and handling event payloads.
2. Implement an event listener on the front-end store that listens for incoming events from the back-end store.
3. Implement an event listener on the back-end store that listens for incoming events from the front-end store.
4. Ensure that events are exchanged in real-time

## Story 3: Compatibility and Callable by Python
### Tasks
1. Ensure compatibility with @brainstack/microstore in JavaScript.
2. Create a Python module that can call and interact with the back-end store.
3. Test the integration between the Python module and the back-end store.

## Story 4: Performance Testing and Optimization
### Tasks
1. Measure latency and data throughput for real-time event exchange.
2. Identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
3. Implement necessary optimizations to ensure low latency and sufficient data throughput.
4. Conduct performance tests to validate that the addon meets the performance requirements.

## Story 5: Future Considerations (JWT Authentication)
### Tasks
1. Research and select a suitable JWT library for both front-end and back-end.
2. Implement JWT token generation and verification on the back-end.
3. Implement token-based authentication for WebSocket connections.
4. Update the front-end to handle JWT tokens for authentication.

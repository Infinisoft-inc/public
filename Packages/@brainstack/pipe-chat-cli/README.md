```

### Adding `bin` field in `package.json`

To make sure the CLI can be run using `npx @brainstack/pipe-chat-cli`, add the `bin` field to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@brainstack/pipe-chat-cli",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "CLI tool to interact with Supabase and AI to improve your database schema",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  },
  "bin": {
    "pipe-chat-cli": "./dist/index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "commander": "^10.0.0",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.0",
    "openai": "^3.0.0",
    "supabase": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^18.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "supabase",
    "openai",
    "cli",
    "database",
    "ai"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### Final Steps

1. Save the deployment script as `deploy.sh`, give it executable permissions using `chmod +x deploy.sh`, and then run it with `./deploy.sh`.
2. Make sure to update the version in `package.json` appropriately before publishing.

With these steps, your CLI tool should be ready to use and can be installed globally or run using `npx @brainstack/pipe-chat-cli`.

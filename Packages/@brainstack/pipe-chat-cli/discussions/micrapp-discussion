  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Day</th>
          <th>Open</th>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
};

export default BusinessHoursTable;
```
**Modified `dto/BusinessHours.ts`**

We need to update the `BusinessHours` interface to reflect the new structure:
```typescript
interface BusinessHours {
  monday: {
    open: string;
    close: string;
  };
  tuesday: {
    open: string;
    close: string;
  };
  wednesday: {
    open: string;
    close: string;
  };
  thursday: {
    open: string;
    close: string;
  };
  friday: {
    open: string;
    close: string;
  };
  saturday: {
    open: string;
    close: string;
  };
  sunday: {
    open: string;
    close: string;
  };
}
```
With these changes, we can now allow users to dynamically enter business hours for each day of the week.
You: To accommodate special hours for holidays or other specific dates, we can introduce a new module into our microapp template. Let's call it `calendar`.

Here's an updated microapp template structure:

The `calendar` module will contain two files: `holidays.ts` and `specialHours.ts`.

`holidays.ts` will be a simple JSON file that lists all the holiday dates:
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2023-12-25",
    "name": "Christmas Day"
  },
  {
    "date": "2024-01-01",
    "name": "New Year's Day"
  },
  {
    "date": "2024-04-01",
    "name": "Easter Monday"
  },
  ...
]
```
`specialHours.ts` will contain the logic to determine the special hours for specific dates. For example:
```typescript
import holidays from './holidays';

const specialHours = (date: Date) => {
  const holiday = holidays.find((holiday) => holiday.date === date.toISOString().split('T')[0]);
  if (holiday) {
    return {
      openingHour: '09:00',
      closingHour: '13:00',
    };
  } else {
    return {
      openingHour: '08:00',
      closingHour: '17:00',
    };
  }
};

export default specialHours;
```
This is a basic implementation, but you can add more complexity to the logic as needed.

Now, in your components or services, you can import and use the `specialHours` function to display the correct hours for each date.

For example, in a `Page.tsx` component:
```typescript
import specialHours from '../calendar/specialHours';

const Page = () => {
  const currentDate = new Date();
  const hours = specialHours(currentDate);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Current Hours</h1>
      <p>Opening Hour: {hours.openingHour}</p>
      <p>Closing Hour: {hours.closingHour}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```
This way, you can easily manage special hours for holidays or other specific dates in your application.
You: From the provided project structure, I can see that we have multiple locations:

1. `app` directory: This seems to be the main application directory, containing various sub-directories and files.
2. `components` directory: This directory contains reusable UI components, such as `CardsNavigation`, `AuthButton`, and others.

Within the `app` directory, we have multiple locations, including:

1. `auth` directory: This contains authentication-related functionality, such as login and callback routes.
2. `login` directory: This contains login-related functionality, including actions, components, and services.
3. `protected` directory: This contains protected routes, including `access`, `approval`, and `contacts` sub-directories.
4. `subscribe` directory: This contains subscription-related functionality, including actions, components, and services.

Each of these locations has its own set of files and sub-directories, which seems to follow a consistent pattern.

Now, considering the microapp template structure you provided, I can see that it's designed to be a self-contained module, with its own `actions`, `components`, `config`, `dto`, `medias`, `services`, `state`, `tests`, and `types` directories.

This microapp template structure can be used to create multiple instances of similar functionality, each with its own configuration and implementation. By combining these microapp templates, we can create more complex patterns and solutions.

How can I help you further? Do you have any specific questions or concerns about this structure, or would you like to discuss how to apply this template to your project?
You: I see you have a project with a well-structured folder and file organization. You have a microapp template with various components, actions, services, and utilities.

From what I understand, you want to create a microapp template that can be composed and combined to form more complex patterns to solve real-world data problems.

Your microapp template consists of several folders and files, including:

1. `actions`: containing action creators for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
2. `components`: holding various UI components, such as forms, lists, pagination, search, and buttons.
3. `config`: with configuration settings.
4. `create`: a page for creating new entities.
5. `dto`: data transfer objects, including mappers and processors for data transformation.
6. `medias`: containing media-related components, such as icons.
7. `services`: providing data access and logging services.
8. `state`: tracking the state of the application.
9. `tests`: unit tests for the application.
10. `types`: type definitions for the application.

The project also has a main `app` folder, which contains several subfolders, including `auth`, `login`, `protected`, `status`, `subscribe`, and others. Each of these subfolders seems to represent a different feature or functionality of the application.

To create a microapp template that can be composed and combined, you might consider the following design patterns:

1. **Modularization**: Break down the application into smaller, independent modules, each with its own set of actions, components, services, and utilities.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Use a dependency injection mechanism to connect modules and allow them to communicate with each other.
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implement an event-driven architecture, where modules communicate through events, allowing them to be decoupled and composed more easily.
4. **Reusability**: Design modules to be reusable across different applications and domains, making it easier to combine them to form more complex patterns.

By applying these design patterns, you can create a microapp template that is modular, flexible, and easy to compose and combine to solve various real-world data problems.
You: Based on the provided microapp template, I understand that you want to implement a feature to manage multiple locations, allowing users to add, edit, and remove locations.

To achieve this, I recommend the following design pattern:

**Location Microapp**

Create a new microapp template instance for managing locations. This microapp will have the following components:

1. **actions**:
        * `createLocation.ts`: action to create a new location
        * `updateLocation.ts`: action to update an existing location
        * `deleteLocation.ts`: action to delete a location
        * `listLocations.ts`: action to retrieve a list of all locations
        * `getLocationById.ts`: action to retrieve a single location by ID
2. **components**:
        * `LocationForm.tsx`: a form component to add/edit location details
        * `LocationList.tsx`: a list component to display all locations
        * `LocationItem.tsx`: an item component to display a single location in the list
        * `Pagination.tsx`: a pagination component to navigate through the list of locations
3. **dto**:
        * `LocationDTO.ts`: a data transfer object to represent a location
        * `LocationDefault.ts`: default values for a new location
4. **services**:
        * `LocationService.ts`: a service to interact with the location data storage (e.g., database or API)
5. **types**:
        * `LocationType.ts`: type definitions for locations

**Implementation**

1. Create a new location:
        * The user fills out the `LocationForm` and submits it.
        * The `createLocation` action is triggered, which calls the `LocationService` to create a new location in the data storage.
        * The new location is added to the list of locations.
2. Edit a location:
        * The user selects a location from the list and clicks the edit button.
        * The `LocationForm` is populated with the selected location's details.
        * The user makes changes to the location details and submits the form.
        * The `updateLocation` action is triggered, which calls the `LocationService` to update the location in the data storage.
3. Remove a location:
        * The user selects a location from the list and clicks the delete button.
        * The `deleteLocation` action is triggered, which calls the `LocationService` to delete the location from the data storage.
        * The location is removed from the list of locations.

**Reusability**

To make this microapp reusable, you can abstract the data storage and API calls in the `LocationService`. This way, you can easily switch between different data storage solutions (e.g., local storage, API, or database) without affecting the rest of the microapp.

By following this design pattern, you can create a robust and reusable microapp for managing multiple locations.
You: So, you want to extend the microapp template to include contact information for each location. This can be achieved by adding new fields to the `dto` section of the microapp template.

Here's an updated `dto` section that includes contact information:
```
dto
├── defaults
│   ├── defaultInsertOperation.ts
│   └── defaultUpdateOperation.ts
├── mappers
│   └── abstractions
│       └── IMapper.ts
└── processors
    ├── abstractions
    │   ├── formToMapperGeneric.ts
    │   └── IDTProcesor.ts
    ├── entityListToItemList.ts
    ├── entityToItem.ts
    ├── formToInsertOperation.ts
    ├── formToUpdateOperation.ts
    └── itemToEntity.ts
    └── contactInformation
        ├── phoneNumber.ts
        ├── emailAddress.ts
        └── address.ts
```
The `contactInformation` section includes three new fields: `phoneNumber`, `emailAddress`, and `address`. These fields will store the contact information for each location.

You can also update the `components` section to include a new `ContactInformationForm.tsx` component that will allow users to input and edit contact information:
```
components
├── forms
│   ├── CreateForm.tsx
│   ├── UpdateForm.tsx
│   └── ContactInformationForm.tsx
...
```
This component can include input fields for phone number, email address, and address.

Additionally, you may want to update the `services` section to include APIs for retrieving and updating contact information:
```
services
├── data
│   ├── create.ts
│   ├── del.ts
│   ├── getById.ts
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── list.ts
│   ├── update.ts
│   └── getContactInformation.ts
│       └── updateContactInformation.ts
...
```
This will allow you to retrieve and update contact information for each location.

By extending the microapp template in this way, you can easily manage contact information for each location within your application.
You: To achieve this, I'll suggest a design pattern for locations that incorporates the microapp template structure you provided. This will enable easy navigation and management of locations.

**Location Microapp Template**

Create a `locations` folder within the `app` directory, mimicking the microapp template structure:
```plain

**Key Components and Pages**

1. **[id]**: A dynamic route for each location, displaying its details.
2. **list**: A page displaying a list of all locations.
3. **create**: A page for creating a new location.
4. **update**: A page for updating an existing location.
5. **delete**: A page for deleting a location.

**Actions**

1. **create.ts**: Handles creating a new location.
2. **del.ts**: Handles deleting a location.
3. **list.ts**: Retrieves a list of all locations.
4. **read.ts**: Retrieves a single location by ID.
5. **update.ts**: Updates an existing location.

**Components**

1. **CreateForm.tsx**: A form for creating a new location.
2. **UpdateForm.tsx**: A form for updating an existing location.
3. **List.tsx**: A list component for displaying locations.
4. **ListItem.tsx**: An individual list item for a location.
5. **Pagination.tsx**: Pagination controls for the list of locations.
6. **Search.tsx**: A search bar for filtering locations.
7. **CreateButton.tsx**: A button for creating a new location.
8. **DeleteButton.tsx**: A button for deleting a location.

**Services**

1. **data**: A service for interacting with the location data storage.
2. **logger**: A logging service for tracking changes to locations.

**DTOs and Processors**

1. **defaults**: Default values for location operations.
2. **mappers**: Mappers for converting between location data and API responses.
3. **processors**: Processors for handling location data transformations.

By structuring the locations feature in this way, you'll have a scalable and maintainable architecture that's easy to navigate and manage.
You: When it comes to services management in the context of your microapp template, I understand that you would like to create a template that can be composed together to form more complex patterns to solve real-world data problems.

From the provided project structure, I notice that there are several service-related folders and files scattered throughout the project. Here are some suggestions on how to manage services in a more organized and scalable way:

**Service Layer**

Create a top-level `services` folder that will hold all service-related logic. This folder can be further divided into subfolders, such as:

* `data`: This folder can contain services related to data access, manipulation, and storage. For example, you can have services for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data.
* `logger`: This folder can contain services related to logging and error handling.
* `auth`: This folder can contain services related to authentication and authorization.

**Service Interfaces**

Define service interfaces that outline the contract for each service. For example, you can create an `IDataService` interface that defines the CRUD operations. This will help ensure that all services implementing this interface provide the necessary functionality.

**Service Implementations**

Create concrete service implementations that adhere to the defined service interfaces. For example, you can create a `DataService` class that implements the `IDataService` interface.

**Dependency Injection**

Use a dependency injection mechanism to provide services to components and other parts of the application. This will help decouple services from each other and make it easier to test and maintain the application.

**Service Registration**

Register services in a centralized location, such as a `serviceRegistry` or a `container`, to make them available to the application. This can be done using a dependency injection framework or a custom implementation.

By organizing services in this way, you can create a scalable and maintainable service management system that can be easily composed and extended to meet the needs of your microapp template.

Do you have any specific questions about implementing service management in your microapp template?
You: It looks like you have a well-structured project with a clear separation of concerns. I can see that you have a Microapp template, which appears to be a reusable component that can be composed together to form more complex applications.

The Microapp template files and folder structure are well-organized, with a clear separation of concerns between actions, components, config, dto, medias, services, state, tests, and types. This structure will make it easy to maintain and extend individual microapps.

From what I can see, the project appears to be a web application with authentication, authorization, and various features such as approval, contacts, and subscription management. The use of TypeScript and React suggests a modern and maintainable tech stack.

Are you planning to use this Microapp template to build multiple applications, or is this a single application with multiple features?
You: Based on the provided microapp template and the functionality you described, I'll outline a possible implementation for creating, editing, and deleting services offered by the organization.

**Assuming the microapp template is for a single service**

Let's create a new microapp by combining the template with the required functionality.

**Components and Pages:**

1. **CreateForm.tsx**: A form component for creating a new service.
2. **UpdateForm.tsx**: A form component for updating an existing service.
3. **List.tsx**: A list component to display all services offered by the organization.
4. **ListItem.tsx**: A list item component to display individual service information.
5. **CreateButton.tsx**: A button component to create a new service.
6. **DeleteButton.tsx**: A button component to delete an existing service.
7. **page.tsx**: A page component to render the service list or create/update forms.

**Actions:**

1. **create.ts**: An action to create a new service.
2. **del.ts**: An action to delete an existing service.
3. **list.ts**: An action to fetch all services offered by the organization.
4. **read.ts**: An action to fetch a single service by ID.
5. **update.ts**: An action to update an existing service.

**Services:**

1. **data**: A service to interact with the backend API for services.
        * **create.ts**: A function to create a new service.
        * **del.ts**: A function to delete an existing service.
        * **getById.ts**: A function to fetch a single service by ID.

        * **list.ts**: A function to fetch all services offered by the organization.
        * **update.ts**: A function to update an existing service.

By combining these components, actions, and services, you'll have a functional microapp for creating, editing, and deleting services offered by the organization.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of these points!
You: It seems you want to create a microapp template that can be used to create multiple services, each with its own set of information such as title, description, pricing, duration, and more.

Based on the provided microapp template files and folder structure, I would suggest the following updates to create a more comprehensive and flexible template for services:

In the updated template, I added a `models` folder to define the service model, which can include properties such as:

* `title`: a string representing the service title
* `description`: a string representing the service description
* `pricing`: an object representing the service pricing (e.g., price, currency, duration)
* `duration`: a string representing the service duration (e.g., "1 hour", "1 day", etc.)
* `imageUrl`: a string representing the service image URL
* `tags`: an array of strings representing the service tags

By using this template, you can create multiple services, each with its own set of information, and easily manage and display them in your application.

Based on the provided microapp template, I assume Room Management is a feature that needs to be implemented. Here's a possible interpretation:

**Room Management Microapp**

The Room Management microapp will allow administrators to manage rooms within an organization. This microapp will be composed of the following components:

**Actions**

* `create.ts`: Creates a new room
* `del.ts`: Deletes an existing room
* `list.ts`: Retrieves a list of all rooms
* `read.ts`: Retrieves the details of a single room
* `update.ts`: Updates an existing room

**Components**

* `CreateForm.tsx`: A form to create a new room
* `UpdateForm.tsx`: A form to update an existing room
* `List.tsx`: A list of all rooms
* `ListItem.tsx`: A single room item in the list
* `Pagination.tsx`: Pagination component for the room list
* `Search.tsx`: A search bar to filter rooms
* `CreateButton.tsx`: A button to create a new room
* `DeleteButton.tsx`: A button to delete a room

**DTO (Data Transfer Objects)**

* `defaults`: Default values for room creation and update operations
* `mappers`: Mappers to transform data between different formats
* `processors`: Processors to handle business logic for room operations

**Media**

* `RoomIcon.tsx`: An icon to represent a room

**Services**

* `data`: Services to interact with the room data storage
* `logger`: Services to log events related to room management

**Types**

* `index.ts`: Type definitions for room-related data structures

**State**

* `README.md`: Documentation for the room management state

**Tests**

* `units`: Unit tests for the room management microapp

**Layout and Page**

* `layout.tsx`: The layout for the room management page
* `page.tsx`: The room management page component

By combining these components, the Room Management microapp will provide a robust and scalable solution for managing rooms within an organization.

Please let me know if this interpretation is correct or if I need to make any adjustments!
You: What a massive project structure!

So, you want to create a microapp template that can be combined to form more complex patterns to solve real-world data problems. You've provided the project file structure, which appears to be a React application with a robust architecture.

To create a microapp template, you can extract the essential components from this project structure. Here's a suggested approach:

1. Identify the core features and functionalities that are common across different microapps.
2. Extract the essential components, such as actions, components, dto, medias, services, and types, from the project structure.
3. Create a minimalistic template that includes only the necessary components and files.
4. Make the template modular and flexible, allowing for easy extension and customization.

Based on the provided project structure, here's a suggested microapp template:

**Microapp Template**

This microapp template includes the essential components for a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. You can then customize and extend this template to fit specific use cases.

When combining multiple microapps to form more complex patterns, you can follow a modular architecture approach, where each microapp is a self-contained unit that can be easily integrated with other microapps.

Please let me know if this suggested approach aligns with your vision, or if you'd like to discuss further refinements.
You: You want to extend the microapp template to accommodate defining rooms within each location. This implies adding a new level of complexity to the data model and UI components.

To accomplish this, we can modify the microapp template as follows:

**Add a new `rooms` folder within the `location` folder**

By adding a `rooms` folder within each `location` folder, we can define a new level of hierarchy, where each location can have multiple rooms. This allows us to manage rooms independently within each location.

The `rooms` folder will have a similar structure to the `locations` folder, with its own set of actions, components, config, dto, medias, services, and state.

This updated microapp template will enable you to define rooms within each location, allowing for a more detailed and organized data model.
You: You want to add a location-based feature to your microapp template, specifically associating each room with a specific location. This can be useful for various use cases, such as filtering rooms by location or displaying the location of a room on a map.

To implement this, you could add a `location` field to the `dto` section of the microapp template. This field could contain properties such as `latitude`, `longitude`, `address`, and `city`.

Here's an updated version of the `dto` section:
```
dto
├── defaults
│   ├── defaultInsertOperation.ts
│   └── defaultUpdateOperation.ts
├── mappers
│   └── abstractions
│       └── IMapper.ts
├── location.ts
│   ├── latitude.ts
│   ├── longitude.ts
│   ├── address.ts
│   └── city.ts
└── processors
    ├── abstractions
    │   ├── formToMapperGeneric.ts
    │   └── IDTProcesor.ts
    ├── entityListToItemList.ts
    ├── entityToItem.ts
    ├── formToInsertOperation.ts
    ├── formToUpdateOperation.ts
    └── itemToEntity.ts
```
The `location.ts` file could contain the schema for the location object, for example:
```
export interface Location {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  address: string;
  city: string;
}
```
You could also add a `location` field to the `create` and `update` actions in the `actions` section, to allow for location data to be sent when creating or updating a room:
```
actions
├── create.ts
│   ├── location: Location
│   └── ...
├── update.ts
│   ├── location: Location
│   └── ...
...
```
This is just one way to implement location-based features in your microapp template. You can adjust the schema and field names according to your specific requirements.

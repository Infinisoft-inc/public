Here is my best spaghetti sauce recipe:

Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 cans (28 oz each) crushed tomatoes
- 1 can (6 oz) tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/4 cup red wine (optional)

Instructions:
1. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute.
4. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Stir well.
5. If using red wine, add it and stir.
6. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Serve over cooked spaghetti and enjoy!

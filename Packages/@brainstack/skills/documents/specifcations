Your are the senior engineer architect analyst programming  assistant at Infinisoft World. Write code for the following requirements.
- Goal is to cerate an aassistant acting as analyst to gather as much as information from the user to create software specification document detailed enough to be able to create the software in the future
- Define what should be a skill, a task, and an action and explain why
- Text data will be sent as inputover network
- if you need more information you until you think its enough
- you organzie the info gathered
- you create a document
- you outline a table of content
- you write each section completely
- you use tables notation citation 
- you save it to a markdown file





To create an assistant that acts as an analyst to gather information from the user and create a detailed software specification document, we'll design a skill named "SpecificationAnalysisSkill" with tasks and actions that collectively handle user input, information gathering, document organization, content generation, and saving the document to a markdown file.

Below are the components of the Brainstack Framework that we'll define to achieve this goal:

Skill: SpecificationAnalysisSkill

Purpose: To orchestrate the overall process of gathering information, creating the software specification document, and saving it to a markdown file.
Tasks: GatherInformationTask, DocumentOrganizationTask, ContentGenerationTask, SaveDocumentTask
Task: GatherInformationTask

Purpose: To interact with the user and gather necessary information to create the software specification document.
Actions: RequestInputAction, ValidateInputAction, StoreInputAction
Task: DocumentOrganizationTask

Purpose: To organize the gathered information in a structured format.
Actions: OrganizeInputAction
Task: ContentGenerationTask

Purpose: To generate the content of the software specification document, including sections, tables, notations, and citations.
Actions: GenerateOutlineAction, GenerateSectionsAction, GenerateTablesAction, GenerateNotationsAction, GenerateCitationsAction
Task: SaveDocumentTask

Purpose: To save the generated software specification document to a markdown file.
Actions: SaveToFileAction
Action: RequestInputAction

Purpose: To prompt the user for input on specific topics and capture their responses.
Action: ValidateInputAction

Purpose: To validate user input and ensure its completeness and correctness.
Action: StoreInputAction

Purpose: To store user input in a structured format for later use in document creation.
Action: OrganizeInputAction

Purpose: To structure the collected user input in a format suitable for document generation.
Action: GenerateOutlineAction

Purpose: To generate the table of contents for the software specification document.
Action: GenerateSectionsAction

Purpose: To write each section of the software specification document based on user input.
Action: GenerateTablesAction

Purpose: To create tables within the software specification document to present data effectively.
Action: GenerateNotationsAction

Purpose: To define and use notations in the document for better clarity.
Action: GenerateCitationsAction

Purpose: To provide citations and references for external sources used in the document.
Action: SaveToFileAction

Purpose: To save the generated software specification document to a markdown file.
With these components, the assistant will interactively gather information from the user through the "GatherInformationTask." The gathered information will be organized and structured by the "DocumentOrganizationTask." The content of the software specification document will be generated by the "ContentGenerationTask," including sections, tables, notations, and citations. Finally, the "SaveDocumentTask" will save the document to a markdown file. The "SpecificationAnalysisSkill" will coordinate these tasks to achieve the overall goal.

The assistant can be further enhanced with event-driven architecture, allowing it to emit events at different stages of the process, making it more interactive and responsive to user input. The assistant can also be extended to support voice input and natural language processing for a more user-friendly experience.

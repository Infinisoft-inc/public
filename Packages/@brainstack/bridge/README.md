# @brainstack/bridge

## Description
The `@brainstack/bridge` package is a powerful event handling and communication tool that allows seamless integration between different components or systems.

## What is it?
The `@brainstack/bridge` package provides a flexible event hub that allows you to subscribe to events and trigger callbacks when those events are emitted. It simplifies the communication between different parts of your application or different systems by providing a centralized event handling mechanism.

## What can you do with it?
- Subscribe to specific events and execute custom logic when those events are emitted.
- Communicate between different components or modules of your application.
- Enable decoupled communication between different systems or services.
- Implement event-driven architectures and workflows.

## Features
- Lightweight and easy to integrate.
- Supports both string-based and regular expression-based event subscriptions.
- Provides efficient event dispatching and handling.
- Customizable event payload and data exchange.
- Compatible with various JavaScript environments and frameworks.

## Installation
You can install the package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @brainstack/bridge
```

or

```bash
yarn add @brainstack/bridge
```

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the `@brainstack/bridge` package:

```javascript
import { createEventHub } from '@brainstack/bridge';
import { createLogger } from '@brainstack/log';
import { uuidv1 } from './utils';

// Create an event hub
const eventHub = createEventHub({
  source: 'unknown',
  logger: createLogger(3),
});

// Subscribe to an event
const unsubscribe = eventHub.on('eventName', (payload) => {
  // Handle the event
  console.log('Event received:', payload);
});

// Emit an event
eventHub.emit('eventName', { message: 'Hello, world!' });

// Unsubscribe from the event
unsubscribe();
```

## Use Cases
### Use Case 1: Real-time Data Synchronization
You can use `@brainstack/bridge` to build real-time data synchronization between different components or modules of your application. By subscribing to specific events related to data changes, you can update the necessary parts of your application in real time.

Here's an example of how you can achieve real-time data synchronization:

1. Set up an event hub instance in your application.
2. Define event handlers to handle data change events.
3. Emit events whenever data changes occur.
4. Subscribe to data change events in the relevant components or modules.
5. Update the UI or trigger specific actions based on the received event data.

### Use Case 2: Inter-service Communication
In a microservices architecture, different services may need to communicate with each other. `@brainstack/bridge` can facilitate inter-service communication by providing a centralized event hub. Each service can subscribe to events related to specific actions or data updates and react accordingly.

Here's an example of how you can use `@brainstack/bridge` for inter-service communication:

1. Create an event hub instance in each service.
2. Define event handlers to handle service-specific events.
3. Emit events when certain actions or data updates occur.
4. Subscribe to relevant events in the target services.
5. Implement the necessary logic to process the received events and trigger appropriate actions.

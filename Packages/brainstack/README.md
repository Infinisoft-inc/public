# Creating a Library

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a library using the provided script.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed (version 12 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager) or Yarn installed

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the script to create a new library. Execute the following command:

   ```shell
   node create-library.mjs
   ```

5. Follow the prompts and enter the name of your package when prompted.

6. The script will create a new directory with the provided package name and copy the template contents into it.

7. The `package.json` file inside the newly created directory will be updated with the package name.

8. The script will also install the necessary dependencies for the library.

9. Once the process completes, your library is ready for use.

## Customizing the Template

The template provided is a starting point for your library. You can modify and customize it according to your specific needs.

- Edit the source files in the `src` directory to implement your library functionality.

- Update the `README.md` file to provide information about your library, usage instructions, and any other relevant details.

- Add additional files or folders as needed for your library structure.

## Usage

To use the library, you can import it into your project using the following syntax:

```javascript
import YourLibraryName from 'your-library-name';

// Use the library functionality
```

Replace `YourLibraryName` with the appropriate name for your library, and `'your-library-name'` with the actual package name specified during the setup process.
